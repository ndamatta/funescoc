This is a personal web development project. All of the code was written in plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS, _no frameworks were used_.<br>
All the media was designed and hand-crafted by **myself**.<br>
<br>

The contents of each page of the website are described in detail here, along with the techniques I employed and the skills they showcase.<br>

* `The navigation menu` which collapses into a "hamburger" button on smaller screens, displays my proficiency in responsive design and user experience optimization. The navigation links themselves, leading to different sections of the website, demonstrate my skill in creating functional and intuitive navigation.<br>
* `The footer` presents contact information and copyright details neatly, reflecting my attention to detail and thoroughness in completing a webpage.<br>

* `The call-to-action section`  encourages users to explore the benefits of becoming a member, highlighting my understanding of user engagement techniques.<br>
* `The meeting banner` appears conditionally based on the day of the week (_Monday or Wednesday_). This interactivity is achieved through JavaScript, showcasing my ability to dynamically show or hide content based on specific conditions, enhancing user engagement.<br>
* `The news section`  effectively communicates significant achievements of the Funes Chamber of Commerce, demonstrating my skill in presenting important information in a clear and concise manner.<br>

* `The main content` showcase information about Chamber-affiliated businesses. This information is presented in two different formats: as a list or in a grid layout using cards.
